(2) All the necessary papers required for the application must be prepared together with the appropriate draft orders of Court.

(3) An undertaking from counsel shall be given to have all the documents (including the originating process) filed in Court the next available working day must be furnished to the Judicial Officer processing the application.

(4) The hearing may take place in the Registry of the State Courts or at any place as directed by the Judicial Officer hearing the matter.

(5) For the avoidance of doubt, the above applies only to civil proceedings in the Magistrates’ Courts or District Courts.

## 111. Duty Registrar and Duty Magistrate

(1) The duties of the Duty Registrar are —

> (a) to hear applications made *ex parte* or by consent (except probate matters) provided that the summons has been entered in the summonses book;

> (b) to grant approval for any matter pertaining to the administration of the Registry, including giving early or urgent dates and allowing inspection of files; and

> (c) to sign and certify documents.

(2) The duties of the Duty Magistrate shall include the examination of complainants when they file a Magistrate’s Complaint.

(3) The duty hours shall be as follows:

> (a) Mondays to Fridays - 9.30 a.m. to 1.00 p.m., and 2.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m.;

> (b) Saturdays - 9.30 a.m. to 1.00 p.m.

(4) Only advocates and solicitors (or, where a party is not represented, a litigant in person) shall appear before the Duty Registrar.

(5)Except where the attendance of the advocate and solicitor is required under paragraph (8), the filing of the relevant documents will be sufficient for the Duty Registrar's disposal of any application or matter.  Documents which are filed using the Electronic Filing Service will be returned to the advocate and solicitor through the Electronic Filing Service to the inbox of the law firm’s computer system or through the service bureau. Documents which are not electronically filed shall be collected from the Registry not earlier than one clear day after the documents have been filed.

(6) All documents which are not required to be filed using the Electronic Filing Service should be duly stamped before presentation to the Duty Registrar for his signature and/or decision.

(7) A solicitor who wishes to attend before a Duty Registrar and to refer him to documents filed using the Electronic Filing Service must either —

> (a) file the document sufficiently far in advance before attending before the Duty Registrar such that the documents are already included in the electronic case file for the Duty Registrar’s reference (and in this regard, solicitors should only attend before the Duty Registrar after they have received notification from the Court that the document has been accepted); or

> (b) attend before the Duty Registrar with the paper documents, if these exist (and in this regard, the Duty Registrar will require the solicitor to give an undertaking to file all the documents by the next working day after the attendance before dealing with the matter).

(8) The advocate and solicitor's attendance is compulsory only:

> (a) when he is requesting an early or urgent date for hearing before the Registrar or Judge;

> (b) when an application or document is returned with the direction “solicitor to attend” ; or

> (c) when so required by any provision of law.

(9) A solicitor may, if he wishes to expedite matters, attend before the Duty Registrar even if his attendance is not ordinarily required.

(10) This Practice Direction shall apply to both civil and criminal proceedings.

## 112. Attendance of solicitors in Court

(1) Subject to Practice Directions 20(12), 20(15) and 28, and except for Pre-Trial Conferences in any action under the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A), a solicitor appearing in any cause or matter may mention for counsel for all other parties provided that:

> (a) the solicitor obtains confirmation of his authority to mention on their behalf for the purpose of the hearing; and
>
> (b) parties have agreed on the order sought.

(2) To avoid doubt, where a solicitor mentions for counsel for all other parties pursuant to paragraph (1), the Court is not bound to make only the order that parties have agreed on.

(3) All solicitors appearing in any cause or matter are to be punctual in attending Court as delay in commencement of hearing leads to wastage of judicial time.  Appropriate sanctions may be imposed for late attendances.

## 113. Attendance at hearings in Chambers

(1) For the avoidance of doubt, the general rule is that hearings in chambers in civil proceedings are private in nature, and that members of the public are not entitled to attend such hearings.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, subject to any written law, the Court may, in its discretion, permit interested persons, such as instructing solicitors, foreign legal counsel and parties to the matter, to attend hearings in chambers. In exercising its discretion, the Court may consider a broad range of factors including —

> (a) the interest that the person seeking permission has in the matter before the Court;

> (b) the interests of the litigants;

> (c) the reasons for which such permission is sought; and

> (d) the Court’s interest in preserving and upholding its authority and dignity.

(3) In granting interested persons the permission to attend hearings in chambers, the Court may, in its discretion, impose the necessary conditions to be complied with.

## 114. Absence from Court on medical grounds

> (a) any party to proceedings;
>
> (b) any witness;
>
> (c) any counsel; or
>
> (d) a Deputy Public Prosecutor or other officer or person appointed by the Attorney-General to assist him or to act as his deputy in the performance of any of the functions or duties of the Public Prosecutor under the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68) or under any other written law,
>
> is required to attend Court and wishes to excuse himself from Court on medical grounds, he must tender or cause to be tendered to the Court an original medical certificate. The medical certificate so tendered must be in the form and contain the information and particulars required by paragraphs (2) to (5).

(2) A medical certificate issued by a Government hospital or clinic may be in the pre-printed form produced by the Ministry of Health, a sample of which appears at Form 22 of Appendix A to these Practice Directions. A medical certificate issued by a restructured hospital or specialist centre may also be in a pre-printed form similar to the sample which appears at Form 22 of Appendix A to these Practice Directions.

>
> (b) contain the name of the medical practitioner who issued the medical certificate;
>

>
> (f) be authenticated by a rubber stamp showing the medical practitioner’s full name and his designation in the hospital or clinic, as the case may be.

(3) If a medical certificate is not in Form 22 of Appendix A to these Practice Directions, then the medical certificate should:

> (a) be addressed to the Court for which the certificate was intended.  It must not merely be addressed to “whomsoever-it-may-concern”. Where the patient is unable to furnish the name of the judicial officer concerned, the relevant medical certificate may be addressed to “The District Judge/Magistrate, State Courts” or “The Registrar, Small Claims Tribunals”, as the case may be;
>
> (b) identify clearly the name of the medical practitioner who issued the certificate;
>
> (c) state the name of the hospital or clinic from which it had been issued;
>
> (d) be signed in full by the medical practitioner and not merely initialled;
>
> (e) be authenticated by a rubber stamp showing the medical practitioner’s full name, designation and any other relevant particulars;
>

>
> (g) contain a statement to the effect that the person to whom the certificate had been issued is medically unfit to attend Court, and specify the date(s) on which the person is unfit to attend Court; and
>
> (h)  bear the date on which it was written, and where this differs from the date of consultation this must be clearly disclosed.

(4) If any portion of the information set out in paragraph (3) is not found in the medical certificate proper, such information should be included in a memorandum attached to the medical certificate.  This memorandum must similarly:

> (a) identify clearly the name of the medical practitioner who issued the memorandum;
>
> (b) contain the name of the hospital or clinic from which it was issued;
>
> (c) be signed in full by the medical practitioner and not  merely initialled; and
>
> (d) be authenticated by a rubber stamp showing the medical practitioner’s full name and designation.

(5) All information and details in any medical certificate or any memorandum must be clearly and legibly printed.

(6) If the Directions set out in paragraphs (2) to (5) are not complied with, the Court may reject the medical certificate and decline to excuse the absence from Court of the person to whom the medical certificate was issued.  The Court may then take any action it deems appropriate.

(7) This Practice Direction shall apply to both civil and criminal proceedings in the State Courts (including the Small Claims Tribunals).

## 115. Precedence and preaudience of Senior Counsel

(1) By virtue of section 31 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161) and existing custom and usage, Senior Counsel are given precedence and the right of preaudience.

(2) In order to give substance to the principle of precedence and preaudience to Senior Counsel, Senior Counsel who intend to appear before Judges or Registrars for summonses hearings should inform the Registrar in writing not later than two clear days before the scheduled hearing date. Matters involving Senior Counsel will thereafter be listed first, in the order of their precedence. If Senior Counsel do not appear at the time their matters come on for hearing according to the list, they will have to wait for their turn in accordance with their queue numbers given by the Queue Management System in the State Courts, subject to the Judge’s or Registrar’s overriding discretion.

(3) All other counsel, including those who appear on behalf of Senior Counsel, will continue to be heard in the order of their queue numbers in accordance with the current practice in the State Courts, subject to the Judge’s or Registrar’s overriding discretion.

## 116. Submissions and examination by leading and assisting counsel

(1) In the event that a party is represented by more than one counsel at a hearing, whether in open Court or in chambers, the making of submissions and the questioning of witnesses may be carried out by one counsel for each party only.

(2) If counsel have divided up their work such that it is necessary or desirable that submissions on different issues be made or certain portions of the examination, cross-examination or re-examination be conducted by different counsel, an application should be made to Court at the commencement of the trial or hearing for leave to do so. The following information should be provided to the Court for the purposes of the application:

> (a) the issues on which each counsel will be making submissions; and/or

> (b) the witnesses to be examined, cross-examined or re-examined by each counsel, or the portions of their evidence for which each counsel will conduct the examination, cross-examination or re-examination.

(3) If leave has been granted in accordance with paragraph (2), counsel should ensure that each confines himself to the issues or portions of evidence in respect of which leave was granted and that there is no overlap in the issues or the examination being dealt with by different counsel for the same party.  Further, counsel must not repeat, clarify or expand on any submissions or portions thereof that have been made by another counsel for the same party or examine, cross-examine or re-examine witnesses on portions of their evidence dealt with by another counsel for the same party.

(4) If leave of the Court is not sought in accordance with paragraph (2), only one counsel will be allowed to make submissions or conduct examination for a party throughout the hearing.

(5) This Practice Direction shall apply to both civil and criminal proceedings.

## 117. Court dress

(1) The attire for male advocates and solicitors appearing in open Court will be an ordinary long-sleeved white shirt with a turn-down collar, a tie of a subdued or sober colour, a dark jacket, dark trousers and black or plain coloured shoes.

(2) The attire for female advocates and solicitors appearing in open Court will be a long-sleeved white blouse high to the neck, a dark jacket, a dark skirt or dark trousers and black or plain coloured shoes.  Conspicuous jewellery or ornaments should not be worn.

(3) When appearing before the Judge or Registrar in chambers, the attire for both men and women will be the same as for open Court.

## 118. Use of electronic and other devices

(1) In order to maintain the dignity of Court proceedings in the State Courts, court users are strictly prohibited from making any video and/or image recording in all hearings and sessions in open Court or in chambers.

(2) Additionally, audio recording during a hearing or session is strictly prohibited without prior approval of the Judge or Registrar hearing the matter or the person presiding over the session. 

(3) Court users are permitted to use notebooks, tablets, mobile phones and other electronic devices for the following purposes provided that such use does not in any way disrupt or trivialise the proceedings:

> (a)	to take notes of evidence during all hearings or sessions and for any other purpose pertaining to the proceedings; or

> (b)	to communicate with external parties during all hearings in open Court unless the Judge hearing the matter or the person    presiding over the session expressly disallows this.

(4) This Practice Direction shall apply to both civil and criminal proceedings in the State Courts (including the Small Claims Tribunals). 

(5) For the avoidance of doubt, this Practice Direction shall also apply to all alternative dispute resolution and counselling sessions conducted in the State Courts.
