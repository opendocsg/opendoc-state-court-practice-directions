In order to ensure clarity in the audio transmissions, no two persons should speak simultaneously into the microphones.

(8) Video cameras installed in the courtroom will enable images of the proceedings in the courtroom to be relayed to the witness giving evidence by means of a video link.  Images of the witness giving evidence will be relayed and may be viewed by all persons present from television monitors which are placed strategically within the courtroom.  To ensure that there is eye contact with the witness, prosecutors and counsel should face the television monitor squarely as the cameras are mounted on top of the television monitor.
